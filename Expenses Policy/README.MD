# Infinity Works Expenses Policy and Receipt Processing

One of the things we’re keen to have in place is an easy, specific, clear expenses policy - one where people raising expenses can understand what they can spend, who approves and validates their expenses claims, and how much they’re going to be paid and by when.

It is extremely important for Infinity Works that we process expenses and receipts quickly to allow us to manage the internal accounts properly and promptly and pay you back as quickly as we can.

Additionally, we have been extremely poor at ensuring that VAT receipts are provided in a timely fashion - this has impacted our ability to reclaim VAT effectively. Ultimately we’d much prefer to spend our money on our team than paying unnecessary VAT!

In order to make sure we do this effectively, we have put this guidance together to underline the process.

## Who validates my expenses claim?
Your Account Lead or a Board Member will approve your expenses claim (with receipts) according to the following spending guidance.

## How do I create a claim?
We are now using Expensify to make recording your expenses as easy and swift as possible.  To use Expensify you’ll need to be registered. If you haven’t registered, you can use this use this link to register https://join.my.expensify.com?team=FADA3AA6B709CC6E&thanks=tom.walton%40infinityworks.com

Once you’ve joined, you can log in using your Google account.  

The best way to create an expense claim is via the mobile app, which is downloadable from the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/expensify-expense-reports-receipt-tracking/id471713959?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.me.mobiexpensifyg&hl=en_GB).

There are 2 ways to create a claim:

1. Standard Expenses
2. Distance i.e. fuel reimbursement

## To create a standard expense, follow these simple instructions: ##

1. **Open the Expensify app and click on the green camera icon** 
2. **Take a photo of your receipt** 
3.  **Categorise your expense**
- Category: Pick an appropriate category from the options provided.
- Comment: Comments are mandatory, see below for what we need for each expense category.
- Office: Pick from Leeds, London, Edinburgh, or Manchester, i.e. your home office unless you’re seconded elsewhere.
-  the Expense is rechargeable to a client please categorise it ‘Expenses to recharge to client - Expensify’ 
Category, Comments and Office location are mandatory fields.
4. **Verify everything is set as expected**|
If this expense is to be recharged to a client please use the category ‘Expenses to recharge to client - Expensify’ then
Tag the  customer, e.g. Sainsbury’s

By default all expenses are reimbursable. 

## To create a distance expense, follow these simple instructions: ##

1. **Open the Expensify app and click on the blue ‘+’ icon in the top right hand corner**
2. **Select Distance**
3. **Select the best method to record your trip**
Note: I’ve used distance.

**Distance** - enter the exact mileage travelled
**Odometer** - take a before and after photo of your odometer
**GPS** - Set a starting point via GPS as you commence your trip.  Then set a end point via GPS when you have arrived at your destination.

4. **Enter your trip details**
- **Distance:** The distance travelled.
- **Category:** Pick an appropriate category from the options provided.If it is rechargeable to client please code it to ‘Expenses to recharge to client - Expensify’ 
- **Comment:** Comments are mandatory, click here for a list of what we need for a distance claim.
- **Office:** Pick from Leeds, London or Manchester, i.e. your home office unless you’re seconded elsewhere.

**Distance, Category, Comments and Office location are mandatory fields.**

5. **Verify everything is set as expected**

_If you are recharging this expense to a client you’ll also need to set the following fields:_
- **Tag the  customer**, e.g. Sainsbury’s
- **Tag the project**, e.g. Sainsbury’s - Note these are generic at present, but will start to reflect our actual projects in the near future.


By default all expenses are reimbursable.  You’ll need to switch this off if you’ve used a company card.

6. **Add a photo of your fuel receipt**
Go to the Menu > My Expenses
Click on your distance expense
Click on the photo with the ‘!’ icon
Take a picture of your fuel receipt
Click Save.

**When and how will I get paid?**
Your expense claim will be paid once approved. The payment runs are twice monthly the first one being on or around the 15th of the month and on the last working day of the month. 

**What do I need in order for my expense claim to be approved and paid?.**
In all instances a VAT receipt MUST be provided where possible - exceptions to this will be reviewed on a case by case basis and may be escalated to a member of the Board.

A VAT receipt will include the provider’s VAT number and a breakdown of the cost including VAT. Note that some common expenses, e.g. train fares or take away cold drinks are VAT exempt, and many small traders are not VAT registered. It’s always best to ask for a VAT receipt first and accept a non-VAT receipt if that is all that is available.

There are a number of categories of expenses that you will raise, and here’s guidance on what the Admin team need in order to complete and pay your claim quickly.

**When claiming for expenses when entertaining our clients:**
- VAT receipt
- Tag the customer and project, e.g. Sainsbury’s
- Split of clients vs IW people? (e.g. 50% were client attendees)

**For Staff Entertaining:**
- VAT receipt
- Who was there (if >5 people please provide the team name)
- If there are any attendees that are not IW Staff - this is Client entertaining.

**For Advocacy sessions:**
- VAT receipt
- Who was there?

**For Mileage (to allow us to reclaim VAT):**
- Fuel receipt (doesn’t have to be for that particular journey, but must be within 90 days)
- Diesel or petrol car?
- Engine size?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Put to the 
- Postcode to and from
- How many miles?

**For Travel, e.g. Train, Air, Road (though we expect this to be booked via the Admin team in all but emergency circumstances):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- To / From?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.

**For Accommodation (though we expect this to be booked via the Admin team in all but emergency circumstances):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- Location stayed
- Number of nights
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.


For Taxis to client sites:

Who was there?
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.

_**Please note - travel cannot be claimed from your home to your regular place of business (typically your home IW office)**._

**For Subsistence:**
VAT Receipt
Claim for your own subsistence only.
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? Allocate the claim to the ‘Expenses to recharge to client - Expensify’ category

**What can I spend?**
So we’re clear on what our team can spend (and to allow the people who validate and approve expense claims to approve quickly) we have pulled together the following guidance. Please do your best to keep to these (and the spirit of these) - again, we’d prefer to spend money on things that improve our team and people where possible! 

Obviously with all guidance there is a degree of common sense that needs to be applied, e.g. 
we don’t want you to buy a cheap hotel only to spend a fortune on taxis
we don’t want you walking through dodgy areas to get to a hotel that’s £10 cheaper.

Book things like you would if it was your money, as not to be wasteful whilst taking the same care and consideration for your safety that you would at home.

**Spending limits**

- Advocacy sessions / lunch - up to a maximum of £15/head 

- Subsistence (Food and Drink)
  * Overnight Stay. Up to £40 including breakfast (£25 if breakfast is included with your hotel booking) per overnight stay, supported by receipts (not a flat rate payment)
  * Day travel to temporary workplace £10 supported by receipts, public transport where possible/reasonable e.g. in central London
 
- Hotels (If admin don’t book)
  * UK - Staying outside of London up to £100/night
  * UK - Staying in London up to £200/night
  * Overseas
    * Board approval required for non-client billable bookings
    * Account Lead approval required for client billable bookings. 

- Rail Travel - Standard class unless agreed by Account Lead (for billable travel) or Board (for non-billable travel) . Please always look to book this via the Admin team so we can ensure that all appropriate purchase options are considered. Advance tickets are often cheaper and also more convenient as they offer a ‘print at home’ or mobile option.

- Air Travel - Economy class unless agreed by Account Lead (for billable travel) or Board (for non-billable travel) . Please always look to book this via the Admin team so we can ensure that all appropriate purchase options are considered. Advance tickets are substantially cheaper so help us by getting bookings in as early as possible.

- Taxis - We will support expenses for client meetings, and on occasions where people are working late or commuting late to ensure that people get home safely and quickly.  (Sorry, work nights out do not come under this category unless otherwise agreed in advance!)

- Infiniversary meals - One Meal up to £100 every Infiniversary, supported by a receipt.

- Eyecare - eye test and up to £100 for purchase of glasses (if purely for VDU use. If not, we can only cover the cost of the eye test).

- Staff entertaining - only if pre-approved by Account Lead or Board etc.

- New starter lunches - £15/head for the new starter, advocate and account representative.

Whilst we do not skimp on buying appropriate accessories and IT kit, we expect these things (in all but an emergency) to be purchased via the Admin team. This also goes for office equipment, software, licenses etc. Please do not purchase these independently, as it makes it incredibly difficult for us to manage renewals etc. We always do our best to get those purchased as quickly as possible on your behalf.
